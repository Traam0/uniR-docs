description: Authenticate your institution's users (students, teachers, staff) via the uniR API.

import {Tabs, TabItem} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


Enable user authentication for your institution via the uniR API.

User Authentication allows your school or organization to securely verify the identity of students, teachers, and staff who access your connected applications and services.

Authentication ensures that users can safely sign in to view or manage their personalized academic information, while protecting institutional data.

Typically, user authentication:

- Verifies credentials (email and password) for individual users.
- Issues secure access tokens to authorize user-specific API requests.
- Supports login for all user roles (students, teachers, administrative staff).
- Enables access to personalized features such as timetables, grades, and schedules.

All user authentication requests must include your institution’s API key in the header to ensure they are properly scoped and authorized.

**Base Path: [api/auth/](https://api.unir.com/v1/api/auth/)**
