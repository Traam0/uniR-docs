To get the most out of the uniR API, we recommend using the following tools and setting up your environment for smooth
development and testing.

## Recommended Tools

### PostMan
A popular API client that lets you build, test, and document your API requests with an easy-to-use interface.

### cURL
A command-line tool for making HTTP requests, perfect for quick tests or scripting API calls.

## Environment Setup Tips

- Store your API keys securely â€” avoid hardcoding keys in your source code. Use environment variables or secure vaults. 
- Use HTTPS for all requests to ensure your data and credentials are encrypted. 
- Set up a REST client in your IDE if supported, for faster development. 
- Enable JSON formatting and syntax highlighting in your tools for better readability.

## Additional Recommendations
- If you plan to automate API calls, use SDKs or HTTP libraries available for your programming language.
- Keep an eye on your API usage limits to avoid unexpected rate limiting.
